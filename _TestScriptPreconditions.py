(PROJECTNAME)TestScripts

This is a template class for building test script preconditions using functionality
from the ItemSelectorClass and TestScripts.

This class will act as a "sandbox" where functionality from TestScripts can be tested. This class only uses
one test case out of each category in order to reach a point in flow where a module can be tested. The one test
case used should be the least likely to fail.

note: try/except is redundant since we are calling functions that have it implemented already.
