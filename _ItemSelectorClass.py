(PROJECTNAME)ItemSelectorClass Template

This is a template class for accessing and selecting elements on a web page.

METHOD ASSUMPTIONS:

THERE IS A TRY/EXCEPT CLAUSE FOR EVERY SINGLE METHOD!! THIS IS NOT SHOWN FOR EVERY ONE
BUT IT IS IMPLIED! A single function failure should not mean the whole class fails.

Confirmation messages are also implied

The methods are organized into how (I feel) they should be designed based on the element we are interacting with
(button, select, radio button, etc.)

begin _ItemSelectorClass:

    define class variables here
    ex: driver = webdriver, wait = WebDriverWait
    
    define initialization method(self):
        initialize class variables
        ex. self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(chromepath)
    
    define ItemSelection BUTTON method(self):
        TRY:
            use explicit wait to find the element
            then click using an action chain
            print success message
        EXCEPT:
            print error message
        
    define ItemSelection SELECT method(self, index): < index arg lets you select a choice from outside the class
        try:
            use explicit wait to find the element
            select the index that is passed as an argument
            print success message
        except:
            print error message
            
    define ItemSelection RADIO method(self, index)
        try:
            create an if-else statement that selects the radio button based on the index (case-switch works too, probably better)
            i.e.
            if index == 0
                choose radio button option 0 (you will likely need to find this element via label)
                explicit wait doesnt always work here, might have to use a time.sleep
            else if index == 1
                same thing but next label
            else if index == 2
                same thing but next label
            
            print success message
        except:
            print error message
            
    define ItemSelection INPUT method(self, text)
        try:
            use explicit wait to find the input element
            use an action chain to click the element, then sendkeys "text"
            print success message
        except:
            print error message
